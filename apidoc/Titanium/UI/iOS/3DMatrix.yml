name: Titanium.UI.iOS.3DMatrix
summary: The 3D Matrix is an object for holding values for an affine transformation matrix. 
description: |
    The 3DMatrix is created by the <Titanium.UI.iOS.create3DMatrix> method. 
    
    A 3D matrix, represented by a 4 by 4 matrix, is used to rotate, scale, translate, or skew 
    objects in a three-dimensional space.
    
    You create an `identity matrix` by creating a 3D Matrix with an empty constructor.

methods:
  - name: invert
    summary: Returns a matrix constructed by inverting an existing matrix.
    
  - name: multiply
    summary: Returns a matrix constructed by combining two existing matrices.
    returns:
        type: Titanium.UI.iOS.3DMatrix
    parameters:
      - name: t2
        summary: |
            The second matrix. This matrix is concatenated to the matrix instance against which the 
            function is invoked. The result of this function is the first matrix multiplied by the 
            second matrix. You might perform several multiplications in order to create a single 
            matrix that contains the cumulative effects of several transformations. 
            
            Note that matrix operations are not commutative - the order in which you concatenate 
            matrices is important. That is, the result of multiplying matrix t1 by matrix t2 does 
            not necessarily equal the result of multiplying matrix t2 by matrix t1.
        type: Titanium.UI.iOS.3DMatrix
        
  - name: rotate
    summary: Returns a matrix constructed by rotating an existing matrix.

        summary: The value by which to move x values with the matrix.
        type: Number
        
      - name: ty
        summary: |
            The value by which to move y values with the matrix. Negative values move the target 
            up the display whereas towards the user and negative values away from the user.
        type: Number
        
      - name: tz
        summary: |
            The value by which to move z values with the matrix. Negative values move the target 
            towards the user whereas negative values away from the user.

    example: |

        the display.
        
            var win = Ti.UI.createWindow({
              backgroundColor: 'white'
            });
            
            var label = Ti.UI.createLabel({
              font:{fontSize:50},
              text:'Titanium',
              textAlign:'center',
              top: 100
